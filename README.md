# hw3-jscalc

## Description

This website serves as practice for using javascript and web functions. In this project I create a simple password generator using logic and prompts.

## Installation

You can download the files from GitHub, open them in VS Code, and use "run from browser" to run the page from your own computer.

Alternatively, you can visit the github links I created: 
URL of deployed webpage: https://cjrhansen2.github.io/hw3-jscalc
URL of GitHub repository: https://github.com/cjrhansen2/hw3-jscalc

## Usage

Click "Generate Password" then choose your passowrd options. Once you've gone through the prompts responding with "yes" or "no" your requested password will be generated for you.
